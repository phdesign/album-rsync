# album-rsync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phdesign/album-rsync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phdesign/album-rsync)

A python script to manage synchronising a local directory of photos with a remote storage provider based on an rsync interaction pattern.

## Requirements

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for list of dependencies.  
Supports Python 3.6+  
For Python 2, see https://github.com/phdesign/flickr-rsync

## Installation

### Via PyPI

Install from the python package manager by
```
$ pip install album-rsync
```

### From GitHub repo

Clone the GitHub repo locally

To install globally:
```
$ python setup.py install
```

To install for the current user only:
```
$ python setup.py install --user
```

## Storage providers

Currently the local file system, Flickr and Google Photos are supported. Below is a list of supported features for each.

|                    | Local | Flickr | Google |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Root files         | Yes   | Yes    | No     |
| Delete extra files | Yes   | Yes    | No     |
| Logout             | No    | Yes    | Yes    |

## Authenticating

To authenticate against a storage provider, you will need to setup API keys, and then authorise your account.

To create API keys, visit:
**Flickr:** https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html 
**Google:** https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/photoslibrary.googleapis.com

You will be issued an api key and a secret. To enable the app to use these keys, either:

* For Flickr, provide `--flickr-api-key` and `--flickr-api-secret` arguments to the command line

* For Google, provide `--google-api-key` and `--google-api-secret` arguments to the command line


or create a config file in $HOME/.album-rsync.ini with the following entries

```
[Flickr]

# Your Flickr API key and secret 
# Go to http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply and apply for an API key
API_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
API_SECRET = yyyyyyyyyyyyyy

[Google]

# Your Google API key and secret 
API_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
API_SECRET = yyyyyyyyyyyyyy
```

The first time you perform any action against the storage provider, this app will prompt you to authorise access to your account. For Flickr you may choose to request delete permissions, or write only permissions if you do not want any photos deleted by this app. After logging in an authentication token will be stored in `$HOME/.album-rsync.token`

### Logout

To remove the authentication token for a storage provider, specify the storage provider as the source and pass the `--logout` argument. E.g.

```
$ album-rsync flickr --logout
```

## Listing files

The `--list-only` flag will print a list of files in the source storage provider, this can either be Flickr by specifying the `src` as `flickr`, `google` or a local file system path. Use `--list-sort` to sort the files alphabetically (slower). This feature is useful for manually creating a diff between your local files and Flickr files.

e.g. List all files in Flickr photo sets

```
$ album-rsync flickr --list-only
```

or list sorted files from Google 

```
$ album-rsync google --list-only --list-sort
```

or list all files in a local folder

```
$ album-rsync ~/Pictures --list-only
```

### Tree view vs. csv view

You can change the output from a tree view to a comma separated values view by using `--list-format=tree` or `--list-format=csv`. By default the tree view is used.

e.g. Print in tree format

```
$ album-rsync flickr --list-only --list-format=tree

```

## Listing folders

To just list the top level folders (without all the files). use `--list-folders`. 

```
$ album-rsync ~/Pictures --list-folders
```
## Syncing files

e.g. To copy all files from Flickr to a local folder

```
$ album-rsync flickr ~/Pictures/flickr
```

Or to copy all files from a local folder up to Flickr	

```
$ album-rsync ~/Pictures/flickr flickr
```

You can even copy from a local folder to another local folder

```
$ album-rsync ~/Pictures/from ~/Pictures/to
```

Files are matched by folder names and file names, case insensitively. E.g. if you have a Flickr photoset called `2017-04-16 Easter Camping` and a file called `IMG_2517.jpg`, and you are trying to copy from a folder with `2017-04-16 Easter Camping\IMG_2517.jpg` it will assume this file is the same and will not try to copy it.

### Dry run

Before performing any operations, it's recommended to perform a dry run first, just pass `-n` or `--dry-run` to simulate syncing, without actually copying anything.

### Deleting extra files

>  WARNING: Use of this feature will permanently delete files, be sure you know what you're doing. 

NOTE: Deleting extra files is not supported by the Google storage provider.

Pass `--delete` to delete any extra files from the destination that don't exist in the source. E.g.

```
$ album-rsync ~/Pictures/flickr flickr --delete
```

## Filtering

Filtering is done using regular expressions. The following four options control filtering the files:

* `--include=` specifies a pattern that **file names** must match to be included in the operation
* `--include-dir=` specifies a pattern that **folder names** must match to be included in the operation
* `--exclude=` specifies a pattern that **file names** must NOT match to be included in the operation
* `--exclude-dir=` specifies a pattern that **folder names** must NOT match to be included in the operation

Note that filtering by folders is more performant than by file names, prefer folder name filtering where possible.

Also note that exclude filters take preference and will override include filters.

### Root files

Note that filtering does not apply to root files, root files (files in the target folder if local file system, or files not in a photoset on Flickr) are excluded by default. To include them, use `--root-files`.

## Options

All options can be provided by either editing the config file `album-rsync.ini` or using the command line interface.

### Config and token file discovery

The config file `album-rsync.ini` and token file `album-rsync.token` are searched for in the following locations in order:
* `<current working dir>/album-rsync.ini`
* `<current working dir>/.album-rsync.ini`
* `<users home dir>/album-rsync.ini`
* `<users home dir>/.album-rsync.ini`
* `<executable dir>/album-rsync.ini`
* `<executable dir>/.album-rsync.ini`

The token file is auto generated file containing the authorisation token to access the API. If deleted you will need to authorise the app again when next using it.

## Developing

Install in development mode so source files are symlinked, meaning changes you make to the source files are reflected when you run the package anywhere.
```
$ python setup.py develop
```

Then to uninstall
```
$ python setup.py develop --uninstall
```

## Debugging

Use pdb

```
python -m pdb ./flickr_rsync/__main__.py <parameters>
```

Set a breakpoint

```
b ./flickr_rsync/flickr_storage.py:74
```

Then `c(ontinue)` or `n(ext)` to step over or `s(tep)`  to step into. 

`l(ist)` to show current line and 11 lines of context.

`p(print)` or `pp` (pretty print) to print a variable. E.g.

```
p dir(photo)
pp photo.__dict__
```

To print all properties of variable photo.

`q(uit)` to exit.

## Publishing

Based on [http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html](http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html)

1. Update `album_rsync/_version.py` with the new version number (e.g. 1.1.1)
2. Create a new GitHub release (e.g. `git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Version v1.1.1" && git push --tags`)
3. Push to PyPI
```
$ make deploy
```

## Running tests

If `make` is installed, you can run tests using a virtual environment

```
$ make venv
$ make test
```

which will lint the code and run tests. To just run the linter

```
$ make lint
```

To run the tests without make, use

```
$ python setup.py test
```

### To mark a focused test

Add decorator `@pytest.mark.focus` to test. Run with

```
$ pytest -m focus
```

## Tips

To list just root files only:
```
$ album-rsync flickr --exclude-dir '.*' --root-files --list-only
```

### Videos
Movies should work, but flickr doesn't seem to return the original video when you download it again, it returns a processed video that may have slightly downgraded quality and will not have the same checksum.

## Troubleshooting

#### I get a Version conflict error with the six python package when installing on my Mac

If you're running Mac OSX El Capitan and you get the following error when running `python setup.py test`

```
pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (six 1.4.1 (/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.fra
mework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python), Requirement.parse('six>=1.9'))
```

Do the following:
```
$ sudo pip install --ignore-installed six
```

More details [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165)

#### I get an error 'The Flickr API keys have not been set'

To access Flickr this application needs API keys, go to http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply to sign up for a free personal API key

#### I get an error 'The Flickr API keys have not been set' but I've set them in my config (ini) file

Getting an error `The Flickr API keys have not been set` but you've set them in the config file? Perhaps the application can't find the config file location. Use `-v` or `--verbose` option to print the location of the config file being used.

#### Why are some files are not being shown in the file list / sync?

By default only media files are included in file listings and sync operations. Media files are defined as `\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|tiff|tif|bmp|psd|svg|raw|wmv|avi|mov|mpg|mp4|3gp|ogg|ogv|m2ts)$`. Use `--include=.*` to include all files.

#### I get an error 'The filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect'

If you're seeing an error like this

```
WindowsError: [Error 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'C:\\Users\\xxx\\Pictures" --list-only/*.*'
```

Ensure that you are not using single quotes `'` around a folder path in windows, instead use double quotes `"`. e.g.

```
$ album-rsync "C:\Users\xxx\Pictures" --list-only
```

#### When I try list list in a local folder called 'flickr' it lists my remote flickr files

album-rsync uses the keyword `flickr` as a src or dest to denote pulling the list from flickr. If you have a folder called flickr, just give it a relative or absolute path make it obvious that it's a file path, e.g.

```
$ album-rsync ./flickr --list-only
```

#### If I add tags, they get changed by flickr, e.g. 'extn=mov becomes extnmov'.
Internally flickr removes all whitespace and special characters, so 'extn mov' and 'extn=mov' match 'extnmov'. You can 
edit a tag using this URL:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/{username}/tags/{tagname}/edit/
or go here to manage all tags:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/{username}/tags
And in future put double quotes around your tag to retain special characters

#### I get an error 'UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 0-3: character maps to \<undefined\>'

This error occurs on Windows when you redirect stdout. To fix this, set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8. e.g.

```
$ PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 album-rsync ./flickr --list-only
```
